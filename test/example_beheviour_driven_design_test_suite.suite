#Story: Example Test
As a software developer 
I would like to show that PHP Conform
Can Process an example Suite.

#Scenario: Step Functions
Given a php conform test
When running phpunit
Then step functions from the test suite class should be callable
And step functions included by the class should be callable
And step functions included for only this test should be callable
And values set by outside step classes should be available

#Scenario: Regular Expressions
Given a php conform test
When we call a step function that uses a regular expression syntax to match and store the value of 5
Then the step function should have recieved the specified param value of 5

#Scenario: Dollar Sign Notation
Given a php conform test
When we call a step function that uses the dollar sign notation to match and store the value of 7
Then the step function should have recieved the specified param value of 7

#Scenario: Example of a Data Driven BDD Test
Given a calculator
When I add <input_1> plus <input_2>
Then the total should be <output>

Examples:
    | input_1 | input_2 | output |
    | 20      | 30      | 50     |
    | 2       | 6       | 8      |
    | 3       | 4       | 2      |
                
#Scenario: Example of Data Driven BDD Test with a missing step.
Given a calculator
When I add <input_1b> plus <input_2b>
When I use a a sentance with no matching step function
Then the Data Driven Test Should correctly mark the unimplemented step as pending for that data entry.
And the total should be <output>

Examples:
    | input_1b | input_2b | output |
    | 20       | 30       | 50     |
    | 2        | 6        | 8      |
    | 3        | 4        | 2      |


#Scenario: Example of A Failing Bdd Test
Given a calculator
When I add 3 plus 3
Then the total should be 8

#Scenario: Example of An Incomplete BDD Test
Given a calculator
When I multiply 3 by 5
Then the total should be 15
And the calculator should sing a little tune

#Scenario: Setup and Teardown Methods
Given a php conform test
When running phpunit
Then the setup method should be called
And the teardown method should be called
